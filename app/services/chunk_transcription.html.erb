Here's a detailed explanation of the process:

1. Audio Segmentation (Splitting the Audio):

The first crucial step is to divide your long audio file into smaller, manageable segments.

By Time Duration: The simplest approach is to split the audio into fixed-length chunks based on time. For example, you could create 5-minute, 10-minute, or even shorter segments. The ideal chunk size will depend on the limitations you're encountering with the language model and the desired level of detail in the transcription.
Overlap: It's highly recommended to include a small overlap between consecutive chunks (e.g., 5-10 seconds). This overlap serves a few important purposes:
Context Carry-Over: It provides the language model with some preceding context when transcribing the beginning of a new chunk, which can improve accuracy, especially at sentence boundaries.
Smooth Stitching: It helps you smoothly combine the transcripts of the individual chunks later, minimizing abrupt breaks or missing words at the segment boundaries.
Using Software/Libraries: You'll need tools to perform this audio splitting. Here are a few options depending on your environment:
FFmpeg: A powerful command-line tool that's excellent for audio and video manipulation, including splitting by time.
Audio Editing Software (e.g., Audacity, Adobe Audition): You can manually split the audio using these tools, though it can be time-consuming for very long files.
Programming Libraries (e.g., in Python: pydub, librosa; in Ruby: ruby-audio): These libraries allow you to programmatically load and split audio files based on time. This is ideal for automated processing within your application.
Example using FFmpeg (command-line):

To split an audio file (long_audio.mp3) into 5-minute chunks with a 5-second overlap, you might use a script that iterates through the audio:

Bash

duration=$(ffprobe -i long_audio.mp3 -show_entries format=duration -v quiet -of csv="p=0")
chunk_length=300  # 5 minutes in seconds
overlap=5         # 5 seconds overlap
start=0

while (( $(echo "$start < $duration" | bc -l) )); do
  end_time=$(echo "$start + $chunk_length" | bc -l)
  ffmpeg -i long_audio.mp3 -ss "$start" -to "$end_time" -acodec copy "chunk_$start.mp3"
  start=$(echo "$end_time - $overlap" | bc -l)
done
2. Transcribing Each Chunk:

Once you have your audio segments, you'll process each one individually using your GeminiTranscriptionService.

Loop Through Segments: Your application will need to iterate through the list of audio chunks you created.
Call Your transcribe Method: For each chunk, you'll call your transcribe method, passing the individual audio file as the audio_file parameter.
Store Individual Transcripts: Store the transcription result you receive from Gemini for each audio chunk, keeping track of the order in which the chunks were processed.
3. Stitching the Transcripts Together:

After you have the transcripts for all the individual audio chunks, the next step is to combine them into a single, coherent transcript.

Order Matters: Ensure you combine the transcripts in the correct order based on the order of the audio chunks.
Handling Overlap: This is where the overlap you included during segmentation becomes important. At the boundaries between consecutive transcripts, you might have some duplicated text due to the overlapping audio. You'll need to implement logic to identify and remove these duplicates. This can be done by:
Simple Removal: For a small overlap, you might simply remove the first few or last few words/sentences of the overlapping sections.
More Intelligent Merging: For better accuracy, you could analyze the context at the overlap points and try to identify the most natural way to merge the sentences. This is more complex and might involve some natural language processing techniques.
Concatenation: Once you've handled the overlaps, simply concatenate the cleaned transcripts of each chunk together to form the final, complete transcription.
4. Optional Post-Processing:

After stitching, you might want to perform some additional post-processing on the complete transcript:

Sentence Boundary Correction: Check for any awkward sentence breaks that might have occurred at the chunk boundaries, even with overlap.
Speaker Consistency: If your speaker identification wasn't perfect across chunks, you might need to do some manual review and correction.
Formatting: Apply any final formatting you desire to the complete transcript.
Code Implementation Considerations (Conceptual in Rails):

Ruby

class LongAudioTranscriptionService
  def transcribe_long_audio(long_audio_file)
    chunk_dir = Rails.root.join('tmp', 'audio_chunks')
    FileUtils.mkdir_p(chunk_dir) unless Dir.exist?(chunk_dir)
    chunk_length = 300 # seconds (5 minutes)
    overlap = 5       # seconds

    # Split the audio (you'd need to implement the audio splitting logic here
    # using a library like ruby-audio or by shelling out to FFmpeg)
    audio_chunks = split_audio(long_audio_file, chunk_length, overlap, chunk_dir)

    transcripts = []
    gemini_service = GeminiTranscriptionService.new

    audio_chunks.each_with_index do |chunk_path, index|
      Rails.logger.info("Transcribing chunk #{index + 1} of #{audio_chunks.count}")
      File.open(chunk_path, 'rb') do |chunk_file|
        transcript = gemini_service.transcribe(chunk_file)
        transcripts << transcript if transcript
      end
      File.delete(chunk_path) # Clean up chunk file
    end

    final_transcript = stitch_transcripts(transcripts, overlap)
    FileUtils.rm_rf(chunk_dir) # Clean up chunk directory

    final_transcript
  end

  private

  def split_audio(long_audio_file, chunk_length, overlap, output_dir)
    # Implement audio splitting logic here
    # Returns an array of paths to the created audio chunks
    # (This is a placeholder - you'll need a concrete implementation)
    []
  end

  def stitch_transcripts(transcripts, overlap)
    # Implement logic to combine the transcripts, handling overlaps
    # (This is a placeholder - you'll need a concrete implementation)
    transcripts.join("\n\n") # Simple concatenation for now
  end
end
Key Takeaways for Chunk-by-Chunk Transcription:

Essential for long audio with API limitations.
Requires splitting the audio into manageable segments.
Including overlap is crucial for context and smooth merging.
Stitching the transcripts together and handling overlaps requires careful logic.
Consider using appropriate libraries or tools for audio manipulation.
This detailed explanation should give you a solid understanding of how to approach long audio transcription using a chunk-by-chunk method. Remember that the audio splitting and transcript stitching logic will be the most complex parts to implement.
